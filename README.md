# Non-Dominated-Sorting-Algorithms

Implementation of some non-dominated sorting algorithms:
1. Dominance Degree Approach - Efficienct non-dominated sorting or DDA-ENS
2. Dominance Degree Approach non-dominated sorting or DDA-NS
3. Fast non-dominated sorting or Fast-NS

# Dataset:
Dataset contains randomly generated data for objective values, M = 2, 5, 10, 15.
For each objective, there is data for different number of solutions, N = 100, 200, 300, ... 2000
For each number of solutions, there are 50 dataset files.

Filename format: data_N_M_i, where 1<=i<=50
